                A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just
                for
                display purposes. It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on
                a
                daily basis. A Library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies)
                materials,
                and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed
                materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVDs, CDs and Cassette as well as access
                to
                information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

                A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such
                as a
                government, an institution/ schools, a corporation, or a private individual. In addition to providing
                materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding,
                selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and
                analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources. Hence, librarians go an extra
                mile
                to meet the user's need by ensuring that their users are satisfied with the information
                provided.[citation
                needed] A Librarian is one person who is expected to be very vibrant and innovative especially in this
                digital world.[citation needed]

                    Your Daily Journal The way you think, about yourself, and about your life, determines what kind of
                    experiences you will have. We manifest our fate every step of the way, through our dreams,
                    imaginings,
                    projections, and expectations. But most especially it's how and what we think about ourselves that
                    determines how happy we will be.
